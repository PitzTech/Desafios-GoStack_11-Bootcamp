## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you must create an application to practice what you have learned in React Native!

Now you must continue to develop the application that will store your portfolio repositories, which you have already developed the backend using Node.js, and in the last challenge with ReactJS.


### Application Template

We created a GitHub Template to help you with the challenge.

The template is available in the following URL: **[Access Template](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gostack-template-conceitos-react-native)**

**Tip**: In case you don't know how to use Github repositories as templates, we have a guide in **[our FAQ](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/faq-desafios).**

Navigate to the created folder and open it in the Visual Studio Code, remember to execute the command `yarn` in your terminal in order to install all the dependencies, and you'll have something similar to that:

**Pay attention**: If you are emulating on iOS, in your project folder, navigate to the ios folder by running the `cd ios` command and then run` pod install` to install all dependencies for iOS.

### Application Features

Now that you have the template cloned, and ready to continue, you must open the file **src / App.js**, and complete where there's no code with the code to achieve the objectives of each feature.

- **`List the repositories of your API`**: You should be able to create a list of all the repositories that are registered in your API with the fields **title**, **techs** and number of likes following the pattern `${repository.likes} likes`, just changing the number to be dynamic.

- **`Like one of the repositories retrieve by the API`**: You must be able to give a like to an item in your API through a button with the text **Like** and you must update the number of likes in the listing on the mobile by mutating the state of the application.

### Tests Specification

In each test, you have a brief description of what your application must do in order for the test suits pass.

If you have questions about what the tests are, and how to interpret them, take a look at **[our FAQ](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-gostack-desafios/tree/master/faq-desafios).**

For this challenge we have the following tests:

- **`should add a like to the like counter of the repository`**: In order for this test to pass, your application must be able to add a like in one of the listed repositories by clicking on the 'Like' button and that update should be viewed on the screen.
